# DATA-662 - MDCH-615

# ðŸ§  Final Project â€” Data 622

**Machine Learning Classification Using Transfer Learning and X-Ray Images**

This project explores the use of **transfer learning** for multi-class classification of chest X-ray images into three clinically meaningful categories: **Normal**, **Viral Pneumonia**, and **Bacterial Pneumonia**. Leveraging the publicly available **CoronaHack Chest X-Ray Dataset**, we benchmarked various state-of-the-art CNN architectures and fine-tuned them for medical image classification tasks.

> ðŸ“Œ Best model: **EfficientNetV2-S**, achieving **92.79% test accuracy** and **0.9780 micro-AUC**.
